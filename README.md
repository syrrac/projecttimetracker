# Project Timetracker 

A BCIT end-of-the-year project for team 19's client. 

## Description

Currently, COMP 3900 students estimate and track their project hours through an Excel template created by Donna (the course instructor). The current system sees that it is unsafe because of the possibility of files being deleted, inefficient because other instructors canâ€™t easily access student files. Project Timetracker hopes to be a permanent solution by being a cloud-based system for instructors and students alike; it will be a central and standardized site for all users. 

The system will be organized in such a way that there will be three main roles: Administrator, Project Manager, and Employee (Student). The Administrator is in charge of creating projects and assigning employees to those projects, and activating and deactivating employees and projects. The Project Manager creates the work breakdown structure of projects and is able to see reports of estimates and actual hours being inputted by employees to see how well a project is being run. Employees simply input their hours for the week.
